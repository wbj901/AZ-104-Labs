## 📌 Overview
In this lab, I implemented **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** to deploy a containerized web application without managing underlying infrastructure. The lab demonstrates how organizations can modernize applications by transitioning from traditional virtual machines to **serverless containers**, reducing operational overhead while maintaining scalability and availability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Deploy an Azure Container Instance using a public Docker image  
- Configure networking for public access using DNS labels  
- Validate container deployment and application availability  
- Review container logs generated by HTTP traffic

## 🧠 Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|------|------------|
| Azure Container Instances (ACI) | Serverless container runtime for deploying containers without managing VMs |
| Docker Images | Portable application packages containing code, runtime, and dependencies |
| Serverless Compute | Compute model where infrastructure management is abstracted away |
| FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) | DNS-based access endpoint for public container access |
| Container Logs | Runtime output used for monitoring and troubleshooting applications |

---

## 🧰 Lab Environment & Tools
- **Azure Portal** – [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)  
- Resource Group: `az104-rg9`  
- Region: **East US**  
- Services Used: Azure Container Instances, Docker Image (ACI Hello World)

## 🔧 Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Deploy an Azure Container Instance
1. Created a new **Azure Container Instance** using a **Quickstart Docker image** (`aci-helloworld`).  
2. Configured the container with a **public DNS name label** to enable browser-based access.  
3. Disabled container diagnostics logging during deployment to reduce overhead.  
4. Reviewed and validated deployment settings before provisioning the container instance.  

### Task 2: Test and Verify Deployment
1. Verified that the container instance status was **Running** in the Azure Portal.  
2. Accessed the containerized web application via its **FQDN** over port 80.  
3. Refreshed the application multiple times to generate HTTP request logs.  
4. Reviewed container logs to confirm successful GET requests from the browser.  

---

## 📈 Outcome Summary
By completing this lab, I successfully deployed a containerized web application using Azure Container Instances. The lab validated that ACI provides a fast, lightweight, and infrastructure-free approach to running containers, making it ideal for short-lived workloads, testing environments, and microservices.

---

## 🏢 Business Relevance
Azure Container Instances are commonly used by organizations to:
- Rapidly deploy applications without provisioning or maintaining virtual machines  
- Run **event-driven or short-lived workloads** such as batch jobs or automation tasks  
- Reduce operational complexity when compared to traditional VM-based deployments  
- Support cloud-native and microservices architectures with minimal overhead  

This lab mirrors real-world scenarios where teams need fast, scalable compute without the burden of infrastructure management.

## 🧹 Cleanup
To avoid unnecessary costs, delete the lab resources when finished:

- **Azure Portal**: Delete the resource group `az104-rg9`  
- **Azure PowerShell**:  
  ```powershell
  Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name az104-rg9
  ```
