## 📌 Overview
In this lab, I deployed and validated an **Azure Container App (ACA)** using a managed container environment. Azure Container Apps provide a serverless platform for running containerized workloads without the operational overhead of managing Kubernetes clusters. This lab demonstrates how organizations can modernize applications while minimizing infrastructure management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create an Azure Container Apps environment  
- Deploy a containerized application using a quickstart image  
- Validate external access using the application’s DNS endpoint  
- Understand the benefits of Azure Container Apps versus traditional VM-based deployments  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Azure Container Apps (ACA) | Serverless platform for running containerized applications without managing Kubernetes infrastructure |
| Container App Environment | Secure boundary that hosts container apps and manages networking and observability |
| Quickstart Container Image | Prebuilt sample containers used for rapid deployment and validation |
| Ingress & DNS | Built-in HTTPS endpoint provided automatically for public access |
| PaaS Compute | Platform-managed compute that reduces operational overhead |

## 🧰 Lab Environment & Tools
- **Azure Portal** – https://portal.azure.com  
- Subscription: Azure (varies by user)  
- Region: **East US**  
- Resource Group: `az104-rg9`  
- Services Used:
  - Azure Container Apps
  - Container Apps Environment

---

## 🔧 Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Create and Configure an Azure Container App
1. Navigated to **Container Apps** in the Azure portal.  
2. Created a new **Container App** using the following configuration:
   - Resource Group: `az104-rg9`
   - Container App Name: `my-app`
   - Region: East US  
   - Environment: New environment named `my-environment`  
3. Enabled **Quickstart image** and selected **Simple hello world container**.  
4. Reviewed settings and successfully deployed the container app.  

> **Note:** Deployment took several minutes while the managed environment was provisioned.

---

### Task 2: Test and Verify Deployment
1. Opened the deployed container app resource.  
2. Selected the **Application URL** generated by Azure Container Apps.  
3. Confirmed successful deployment by viewing the message:  
   **“Your Azure Container Apps app is live.”**

---

## 📈 Outcome Summary
By completing this lab, I successfully deployed a containerized web application using Azure Container Apps. The application was publicly accessible via a Microsoft-managed DNS endpoint without requiring manual network or load balancer configuration. This validates Azure Container Apps as a streamlined, production-ready PaaS solution for container workloads.

---

## 🏢 Business Relevance
Azure Container Apps enable organizations to:
- Modernize legacy applications without managing servers or Kubernetes clusters  
- Reduce operational overhead with **serverless container execution**  
- Improve scalability and reliability using built-in ingress and orchestration  
- Accelerate development by deploying containers quickly using managed environments  

This approach is ideal for web apps, APIs, background processors, and microservices.

Azure Container Apps will provide a DNS name for the application. Copy and navigate to this URL |

## 🧹 Cleanup
If you are using **your own subscription**, delete resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

**Option 1: Azure Portal**
- Navigate to the resource group `az104-rg9`
- Select **Delete resource group**
- Confirm deletion

**Option 2: Azure PowerShell**
```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name az104-rg9
```
